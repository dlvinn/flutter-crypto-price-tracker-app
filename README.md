The Cryptocurrency Tracker App is a powerful tool designed to provide users with real-time updates on cryptocurrency data, right at their fingertips. Leveraging the latest in Flutter technology and WebSocket communication, this app offers a seamless user experience for both iOS and Android users.

Features:

1-Real-Time Data Updates: Connects to the Kraken WebSocket API to fetch real-time data on various cryptocurrency pairs.

2-Customizable Pair Selection: Allows users to choose their preferred cryptocurrency pairs, such as Bitcoin to US Dollar (BTC/USD) or Ethereum to Euro (ETH/EUR).

3-Comprehensive Data Display: Presents essential metrics like ask price, bid price, volume, trades, and more in a clear and organized manner.

due to not supporting websocket stream from the netlify the crypto_details page is not showing in the [netlify link](https://65fb31def29d690d61a9046d--grand-daifuku-144cc7.netlify.app/) of the app however ii will provide the ui for both of the pages here,
